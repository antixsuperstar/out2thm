# out2thm
Small script to convert Outlook exported mailing lists to THM format, for its use in Mozilla Thunderbird.

The THM format is simple enough and it's used by the extension MoreFunctionsForAddressBook (https://freeshell.de/~kaosmos/morecols-en.html).

This script is intended to run cross-platform, but I've only tested it on a Windows 7 PC. Comments are welcome :)
